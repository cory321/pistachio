# Pistachio

The Green Nut.

Displays Greenhouse candidates by department/job.

Displays recent Gmail messages and imports them into Greenhouse.

## Installing

1. Install the Node.js version listed in the "engines" section of package.json. We recommend using `nvm` to manage node installs. After installing `nvm`, you can run `nvm use` to set the correct node version in that terminal.
2. `yarn install` (if yarn isn't available, enter `corepack enable` in the terminal then try again)
3. `yarn start`. This will watch your filesystem for changes and recompile frontend assets if necessary. If you don't plan to work on the frontend, this step can be skipped.
4. Install `docker`
5. Run `yarn wp-env:start` and wait until it's ready. This command creates the necessary Docker containers: a fully working WordPress install on port 8082, and a database. It also creates a container for tests, but you don't need to worry about it because you won't be accessing it directly.
6. `yarn wp-env:setup`. This will finish up doing the necessary things needed to run the Pistachio plugin (like runnning composer install, activating the plugin, etc.).

## Uninstalling

If something related to the Docker setup breaks, there is an easy way to remove everything and start from scratch:

1. `yarn wp-env:destroy`. This removes the created Docker containers, volumes, and networks that were created for this setup. This is a pretty harmless thing to do because only Docker-related infrastructure is removed; all the code in the repo is left untouched.
2. `docker image prune`. This command will delete unused images that Docker regards as "dangling", which means that they are not being used by any container. This might remove images that you (or other Docker setups in your computer) might have downloaded. This is also pretty safe as any images needed by Docker will be downloaded upon request. The only downside to executing this command is having to re-download them, which can take considerable time depending on your internet connection speed.

## Setting up Xdebug

### Enabling Xdebug

If you just need the step debugger: `npm run wp-env start -- --xdebug`

If you also want the profiler and trace functionality:  `npm run wp-env start -- --xdebug=profile,trace,debug`

After this step, you need to configure your IDE of choice to use Xdebug. We include instructions to use VSCode because it's the most common one, but you can configure your preferred IDE following these guidelines:

- Listen to Xdebug in port 9003
- File mapping: the directory "/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/pistachio" in the Docker container should be mapped to the root of the project (where this README lives) in your host machine. 


### Setting up VSCode for step debugging 

If you are using VSCode you can install the php-debug extension `ext install php-debug` from the command palette, or you can visit the [php-debug  extension page for more information](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xdebug.php-debug).

To configure the php-debug adapter, use the following configuration in your `.vscode/launch.json` file. 

```json
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "Listen for Xdebug",
			"type": "php",
			"request": "launch",
			"port": 9003,
			"pathMappings": {
				"/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/pistachio": "${workspaceFolder}"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

## Notes for Windows users

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is required for running this project on Windows, and the `yarn` commands should be run in the WSL terminal.
If available, WSL 2 is recommended and shouldn't require any additional setup.

#### Running Docker in WSL 1
1. Follow the instructions in [this article](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly) to have docker running in WSL 1.
2. When checking out this repository, make sure you do that inside the Windows filesystem (e.g. `c/Users/USERNAME/dev/pistachio-your-name`). This will ensure docker for windows has full access to it.

#### Running Docker in WSL 2
Some trial candidates have found it easier to get the application running under WSL 2. 
1. Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/)
2. As [suggested here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60708229/wsl2-cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon/72617404#72617404) turn off the 'Expose daemon' option under the Docker Desktop general settings.
3. If there are problems connecting to Docker, eg. you get a "Could not connect to Docker. Are you sure it is running?" message try running `unset DOCKER_HOST` in the linux terminal.

#### Line Endings
Make sure you have **Linux line endings** and that Git doesn't convert them. Command `git config core.autocrlf` should return `false`. Shell scripts will not work in Linux containers if you use Windows line endings!
If you already cloned repository with `autocrlf` = true, follow [this article](https://help.github.com/en/articles/dealing-with-line-endings#refreshing-a-repository-after-changing-line-endings) to change them.
Alternatively, it's easier to just:

```
rm -rf <repo>
mkdir <repo>
cd <repo>
git init
git config core.autocrlf false
git remote add origin <url>
git fetch origin
git checkout -b trunk --track origin/trunk
```

## Doing

Visit http://localhost:8082/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pistachio â€” you should see the UI. The username is `admin` and the password is `password`.

## Tests

We like tests :) Make sure you run them before starting out!

PHP unit tests can be run with:

`yarn test-unit-php`

JavaScript unit tests can be run with:

`yarn test-unit-js`

## Coding standards

For PHP, we use PHP Code Sniffer with the WordPress coding standards. You can run the linter
with: `yarn lint-php`. You can attempt to fix any standard violations `phpcs` finds with
`yarn lint-php:fix`.

The PHP linter runs in a Docker container, but you can always install `phpcs` with the WordPress
coding standards locally, for integration with your IDE or text editor.

For JavaScript, we use `eslint`. You can run `yarn lint-js`, or set up `eslint` to be run in your
text editor/IDE.
