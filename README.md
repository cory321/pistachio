Tests
-----

We like tests :) Make sure you run them before starting out!

PHP unit tests can be run with:

`npm run test-unit-php`, before you do this you should run the Docker containers in
which these tests will be run in, by using: `npm run test-unit-php:run-docker`. You'll likely have
to run `npm run test-unit-php:setup` the very first time as well, to set up some test instrumentation.

JavaScript unit tests can be run with:

`npm run test-unit-js`

Coding standards
----------------

For PHP, we use PHP Code Sniffer with the WordPress coding standards. You can run the linter
with: `npm run lint-php`. You can attempt to fix any standard violations `phpcs` finds with
`npm run lint-php:fix`.

The PHP linter runs in a Docker container, but you can always install `phpcs` with the WordPress
coding standards locally, for integration with your IDE or text editor.

For JavaScript, we use `eslint`. You can run `npm run lint-js`, or set up `eslint` to be run in your
text editor/IDE.
